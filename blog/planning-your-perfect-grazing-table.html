					<h2>It's all the rage...</h2>
					<p>So, you've decided to have a grazing table at your next event — how exciting! 🌿 Whether it's a
						milestone celebration, a cozy dinner, or a vibrant gathering of friends, a grazing table is more
						than just food — it's a visual centerpiece, a conversation starter, and an experience that sets
						the tone for your event. To make the most of it, it helps to spend a little time thinking
						through your vision. Here are a few simple things to consider before we start designing your
						table — your thoughts and inputs will help me bring your dream setup to life.</p>

					<h2>✨ What are we celebrating?</h2>
					<p>Start by thinking about the heart of the occasion. Is it playful and joyous, like a birthday or
						baby shower? Or more elegant and intimate, like an anniversary dinner or engagement party? The
						tone of your celebration helps guide everything — from the colors we use to the style of food
						that fits best. Every table tells a story, and the mood of your event sets the first chapter.
					</p>

					<h2>🎨 Think in colors and mood</h2>
					<p>A grazing table isn't just about food — it's about design. The table merges food and décor into
						one visually stunning masterpiece, so the color palette matters. Think of the colors you'd love
						to see when your guests walk in — soft pastels for a dreamy afternoon, bold jewel tones for
						festive evenings, or earthy neutrals for an organic, minimalist look.</p>
					<p>If you already have event décor in place, consider how the grazing table can complement the rest
						of the setup — the flowers, the linens, the theme. Together, we'll ensure the table feels like
						it was always meant to be part of your celebration.</p>

					<h2>🍇 Let's talk food balance</h2>
					<p>Every grazing table has its own rhythm — a flow from small bites to mains to desserts. Before we
						begin, think about what kind of balance you'd like:</p>
					<ul style="list-style: none;">
						<li>🥂 <strong>Appetizer or finger-food heavy</strong> – great for cocktail hours or mingling
							events.</li>
						<li>🍛 <strong>Main-course inspired</strong> – perfect for smaller, seated gatherings where
							guests will graze more leisurely.</li>
						<li>🍰 <strong>Dessert-forward</strong> – ideal for celebrations where you want sweetness to
							take center stage.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>We'll work together to build the right mix, keeping in mind your guests, timing, and flow of the
						evening.</p>

					<h2>🌸 Consider your guests</h2>
					<p>Who's coming to the table? Are there vegetarians, pescatarians, or guests with dietary
						preferences? The more you can share about your crowd, the better we can plan a spread that feels
						thoughtful and inclusive.</p>

					<h2>🌿 Then… let's dream!</h2>
					<p>Once you've reflected on the mood, colors, and food balance, the rest is where I come in —
						styling, layering, and weaving it all together into a table that's as beautiful as it is
						delicious. This is where creativity takes over — where flavor, color, and design come alive. So
						get excited for what's to come — because soon, you'll see your ideas transformed into an
						unforgettable experience that your guests will talk about long after the last bite.</p>

					<h2>💫 Feeling Overwhelmed?</h2>
					<p>If any of this feels like a lot — don't worry. 🌿 That's exactly what I'm here for. I'll walk you
						through every step — from refining your vision to selecting the right colors and food balance —
						so we can bring your ideas to life together. What you need is the excitement for your event —
						I'll take care of turning that excitement into something truly beautiful.</p>

					<h2>💖 Final Thoughts</h2>
					<p>A grazing table is never just a display of food. It's the heart of your celebration, the place
						where people gather, connect, and remember. And my favorite part? Watching it all come together
						— your story, your colors, your flavors — into one beautiful table that feels uniquely you.
